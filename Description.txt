You have two discrete Applications. One is a Desktop application and other one is a web based
application. The web-based application can be integrated with desktop application and support various
user workflows. The Desktop  application will pass certain metadata to the web application. Using this
metadata, the web application will communicate with external systems and produce additional data
periodically. The periodicity is defined by the Desktop  system and passed via metadata. In this System,
two applications are collaborating to give seamless one-application experience to the user. This system
has to satisfy the following requirements;
 
        1) The generated data in the webapp has to be updated to the Desktop  system ASAP.
        2) Any changes in the Desktop  system, should be communicated to webapp reliably, and the
functionality of webapp changes accordingly.
        3) In case of failures like application crash, the Desktop  system should be able to rerun the
upload/download.
        4) The Desktop  system should be capable of uploading/downloading the data at the same time.
 
 Prefer the Desktop  system to be in C++/C# where all the REST API calls are made via C#.  
 The webapp can be of any technology stack of your choice. Using Node.JS will expedite this implementation.
